# Colordle

Colordle (name not set in stone) is a game made by me, Aaron Putterman. I wanted to take some of the best parts of Wordle and put my own spin on them.

## What I learned from Wordle

1. Guessing, results, logic; repeat
2. Ability to play on mobile, tablet, or desktop
3. Ability to share scores (public score board)

-- write about how each of these played into developing Colordle --
